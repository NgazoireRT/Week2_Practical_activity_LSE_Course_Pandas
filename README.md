Scenario 
Shen Lee is a senior manager at Westside Hospital in Australia where she leads a team of data analysts. The team is responsible for publishing quarterly safety reports based on medical incidents that are documented by the hospital staff. Incidents could include a patient slipping on a wet floor, equipment malfunctioning, or even human errors such as incorrect placement of needles when injecting patients.

The reports must include the emergency number that was called, the emergency protocols followed, and a list of actions taken if the incident required emergency intervention. This same information is included for every incident and published every quarter. Shen Lee will be automating the process of analysing the incident reports, with the ultimate goal of automatically generating the quarterly report to improve safety across the hospital.

The first step in automating the process is to create the three lists in Python. 

Objective
Help Shen Lee create the three lists in Python. Use Pandas Series functions, and compare your results to the outputs provided.
